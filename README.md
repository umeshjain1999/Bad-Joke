# Bad-Joke

Random Bad Joke generator using API.

Randomly generate a bad joke from the API https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/random on press of a button 👻 ( do wait for the punchline though haha )

User Interface was easily created using Reactjs 

Got this idea from https://www.youtube.com/skillthrive channel 🙏
